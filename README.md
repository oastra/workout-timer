# Workout Timer

Workout Timer is a React application designed to guide users through customizable workout routines. The app displays a real-time clock, offers various workout types, and allows users to set parameters like the number of sets, speed of exercises, and break lengths. Additionally, the app includes optional sound feedback for an immersive experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Workout Types**: Choose from various workout types with customizable exercises based on the time of day.
- **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current time and updates every second.
- **Customizable Workout Settings**: Adjust the number of sets, speed of exercises, and break durations.
- **Sound Feedback**: Toggle sound on or off for interaction feedback.
- **Automatic Duration Calculation**: Calculates total workout duration based on user-selected settings.

## Project Structure

- **App.js**: Main component handling workout logic, timer, and UI.
- **Calculator.js**: Component to configure workout settings and calculate duration.
- **ToggleSounds.js**: Component to enable or disable sound feedback.
- **index.js**: The entry point for the React application, where the root component is rendered.
- **index.css**: Contains all global styles, ensuring a consistent, responsive design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
